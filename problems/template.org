* Problem
[Problem here]

Example 1: 
#+begin_src 
  [Expected input output here]
#+end_src

* Solution
#+begin_src python :results output
  class Solution:
      pass
#+end_src

* Thought Process
** Why did I choose this particular implementation?
** What is the time/space complexity of my solution? How do I know?
** How do better solutions differ from my own?
** What mistakes did I make?
** What can I do next time to make sure I don't make the same mistakes again?

* Other Solution 1
#+begin_src python :results output
  class Solution:
      pass
#+end_src
** Explanation (in my words)
*** How does their solution work?
*** What is the space/time complexity of their solution?
